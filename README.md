Oxeye Parsing Library
----

Work in progress.

## Testing and development

Adding new elements to Oxeye works best with Test-driven development practices.

Use test code under `tests/` to build capabilities up from scratch, and run
them frequently through pytest:

```bash
pytest tests/my_new_test_suite.py
```
